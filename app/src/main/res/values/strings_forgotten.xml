    <!--Campaign introduction-->
    <string name="forgotten_introduction"><b>Prologue</b>\n
    \nTuesday, June 2nd, 1925\n
    \nThere will be no rest for us this summer, it seems.\n
    \nToday I met with Harlan Earnstone, a historical theorist at Miskatonic University and an old friend of mine.
        He’d said he had a job offer for me, but frankly, I didn’t know what to expect.\n
    \nHarlan introduced me to an associate of his: Alejandro Vela, a distinguished historian from across the southern
        border. Mr. Vela is a graduate of a prestigious university in Mexico City, and has spent many years
        researching the Aztec Empire. He claims that he has found evidence regarding the existence of an unheard-of
        Aztec city-state called Eztli. His strange and unprecedented findings were not accepted by the university,
        and he’s become a pariah among his peers.\n
    \nAlejandro came to Arkham to seek funding for an expedition into the rainforests of southern Mexico, where he
        believes that the ruins of the Eztli altepetl lie undiscovered. His description of this city-state’s origins
        defies modern understanding of Mesoamerican history. Despite this—or, knowing my old friend, because of
        this—Harlan is enthralled by Alejandro’s discoveries. Miskatonic University has agreed to fund the expedition
        (albeit meagerly), and Harlan wants me to go along.\n
    \nThe way I see it, there’s a good chance we’re looking for something that doesn’t even exist. But if there’s
        even a slight chance these Eztli people existed, the historical significance would be profound. We debated
        the issue for some time, but in the end, we accepted Alejandro’s offer. Preparations are underway, and we
        should be setting off by the end of the month. With any luck, we’ll have this journal filled with all manner
        of interesting discoveries. If not, perhaps it’ll be a nice wedge to place beneath Harlan’s lopsided desk.</string>

        my ears every time I began to drift off. Even when I finally slept, I would soon be startled awake by the

    <string name="expeditions_end_one">Friday, July 17th, 1925\n
    \nWe have finally made it back to Arkham, our expedition a “success.” Alejandro is excited to report his findings
        to the university. How he maintains his starry-eyed idealism after the hell we went through in the jungle is
        beyond me. His attention is fixated on the strange relic that we discovered in the ruins. I wish we knew a
        little more about the artifact’s origins. It unsettles me greatly. It hums at all times and pulses with an
        otherworldly energy I can scarcely describe. As we traveled home with the artifact in tow, our nights were
        plagued by bizarre nightmares: dreams of other worlds and civilizations.\n
    \nAlejandro wants to bring the relic to the Miskatonic Museum, to put on display along with the other Eztli
        artifacts we discovered. My feelings are mixed. At the museum, it will receive proper care, and historians
        will be able to study it and perhaps even discern its purpose. However, I fear that the relic may be too
        dangerous for the public. After all, we still have no idea what the damned thing even is. Alejandro would
        hate it, but perhaps it would be better to keep the relic somewhere safe, where Harlan and I can study it in
        private. I’ll have to decide tonight; after tomorrow, there won’t be time to change my mind…</string>
    <string name="expeditions_end_two">Sunday, July 19th, 1925\n
    \nI’ve decided to give custody of the relic to Alejandro. This entire expedition was based on his research, after
        all—he should be the one to study it. If anyone can discover the relic’s secrets, it’s him.\n
    \nThe relic is to be the centerpiece of a new exhibit at the museum. Alejandro has already written extensively
        about our discoveries, but his work has only just begun. Many mysteries about our expedition remain. How have
        the Eztli people remained undiscovered for so long? Why did they appear to be guarding the jungle, and from
        what? Who really built the temple ruins we explored? I have no doubt Alejandro will uncover the answers to
        these questions, given enough time.\n
    \nAs for me, my role in this endeavor has ended. However, I have yet to relax. My thoughts are constantly in the
        jungle—serpentine figures in the shadows, obsidian arrows embedded in skeletal bodies, malformed voices
        shrieking in the cavernous depths. When I walk through the streets, I find myself drawn toward the museum
        without realizing it, as though possessed to see the relic once again. There is a nagging sensation in the
        back of my mind, as though we have forgotten something important. What must I do to rid myself of—\n
    \n(The journal entry ends abruptly.)\n
        \n<b>If it is not already in an investigator’s deck, any one investigator may choose to add Alejandro Vela to
            his or her deck.</b>\n
        \n<b>Add 1 Tablet chaos token to the chaos bag for the remainder of the campaign.</b>\n
    \nYou drop your pen as a loud knocking at the door startles you, and you jump to your feet. It is almost 2:30 in
        the morning. Who could possibly be at your door at this hour? Your thoughts wander again to the jungle, and
        you are faced with a vision of serpent-creatures attacking you in your own home. Shuddering, you find a
        weapon and approach the front door carefully, ready to strike if need be. You take a long breath and open the
        door.\n
    \nOn the other side is a familiar woman with brown skin, long brown hair, and piercing yellow eyes set in a hard
        glare. Though her attire has changed, you recognize her instantly as Ichtaca, the Eztli warrior you
        encountered in the rainforest. Wearing a long coat and a Bollman hat, she is visibly uncomfortable in her
        shoes. Her jaw is set in anger. You are about to raise your weapon in defense when she lets out a heavy sigh
        and walks slowly over the threshold of your home, shutting your front door behind her. “Whatever you did, you
        have to reverse it,” she intones darkly. “Or we will <i>all</i> cease to exist.”</string>
    <string name="expeditions_end_three">Sunday, July 19th, 1925\n
    \nI’ve decided to keep the relic hidden for now. Alejandro is not happy with my decision, but until we know what
        the orb is capable of, it’s important that it stay somewhere safe, where it won’t endanger others. Harlan
        agrees with me, and has offered to take custody of the relic and keep it in his private office. There, we can
        study the artifact in secret.\n
    \nAlejandro is staying in Arkham for the time being, recording his notes about the expedition and helping the
        museum put together an exhibit displaying our other, less dangerous discoveries. As for me, I hope to find
        answers to other mysteries: How have the Eztli people remained undiscovered for so long? Why did they appear
        to be guarding the jungle, and from what? Who really built the temple ruins we explored?\n
    \nMy thoughts are constantly in the jungle—serpentine figures in the shadows, obsidian arrows embedded in
        skeletal bodies, malformed voices shrieking in the cavernous depths. Each time I leave Harlan’s office, I
        find myself longing to head back and gaze upon the relic once more. There is a nagging sensation in the back
        of my mind, as though we have forgotten something important. What must I do to rid myself of—\n

    \nOn the other side is a familiar woman with brown skin, long brown hair, and piercing yellow eyes set in a hard
        glare. Though her attire has changed, you recognize her instantly as Ichtaca, the Eztli warrior you
        encountered in the rainforest. Wearing a long coat and a Bollman hat, she is visibly uncomfortable in her
        shoes. Her jaw is set in anger. You are about to raise your weapon in defense when she lets out a heavy sigh
        and walks slowly over the threshold of your home, shutting your front door behind her. “Whatever you did, you
        have to reverse it,” she intones darkly. “Or we will <i>all</i> cease to exist.”</string>
    <string name="expeditions_end_five">Harlan Earnstone paces across your living room, dabbing his wrinkled forehead
        with his handkerchief. “It’s my fault. I should never have encouraged them to go on that dreadful
        expedition.” Though your paths have only crossed a few times before, Mr. Earnstone has become a valuable
        contact of yours within Miskatonic University. When the University’s latest expedition returned with only a
        few survivors and a handful of strange, archaic artifacts, he came to you for advice.\n
    \n“I know, I know. I should at least take solace in the fact that the expedition was successful, despite its
        heavy losses. Alejandro was right all along. The Eztli people are real. And yet…I am concerned about some of
        these findings.” Harlan pulls a small leather-bound journal from his suitcase and hands it to you. “Before
        the expedition leader’s tragic death, the leader recorded many of the group’s discoveries in this journal.
        One of the surviving members of the expedition managed to grab it from the camp before fleeing the jungle. I
        think if you read these entries, you’ll understand what I mean. The things they experienced, the creatures
        they encountered…” Harlan shudders and adjusts his glasses with too-shaky hands. “I am concerned not only for
        Alejandro, but for all of us. Read this journal, and if you can, please keep an eye on my colleague.” You
        agree to help, but his worry does not fade. “I only hope that I am not damning you to a similar fate by
        asking for your aid.”\n
    \nYou spend the remainder of that night studying the expedition journal, your mind swimming with thoughts of
        strange serpent-creatures and Aztec warriors. Long after Harlan has left, a loud knocking at the door
        startles you, and you jump to your feet. It is almost 2:30 in the morning. Who could possibly be at your door
        at this hour? You open the front door warily. On the other side is a woman with brown skin, long brown hair,
        and piercing yellow eyes set in a hard glare. She wears a long coat and a Bollman-style hat, visibly
        uncomfortable in her shoes. Her jaw is set in anger. A sudden flash of insight crosses your mind, and you
        realize at once who she must be. After all, you’ve read and re-read the journal’s description of Ichtaca, the
        Eztli warrior. She lets out a heavy sigh and walks slowly over the threshold of your home, shutting your
        front door behind her. “Whatever they did, you have to reverse it,” she intones darkly. “Or we will <i>all
        </i> cease to exist.”</string>

        behind. There is no time to waste. The path to the Nexus lies on familiar ground, not far from the previous

        sag with a burdensome weight. “I feel that I must apologize to you,” she admits, peering into the flickering
        fire. “You have proven yourselves to be both wise and formidable, and I have done nothing but command you and
        endanger you at every turn.” There is a long, peaceful pause between you. “Perhaps there is hope for humanity
        after all,” she says under her breath as she meets your gaze. Does she speak for you? Or for herself, as
        well? Ichtaca rises to her feet after some time. “I trust you to take the first watch. Be on the lookout for
        serpents. They are surely on the lookout for us.” Your camp is quiet for the remainder of the night, but for
        the soothing crackling of the campfire and the choir of chirping insects whose singing fills the night air.\n

    <!--Scenario introductions-->
    <string name="untamed_introduction">Sunday, June 28th, 1925\n
    \nIt’s been a hell of a day. We’ve just set up camp along the northern border of the rainforest where Alejandro
        believes the Eztli once dwelled. The jungle here is dense and untamed. The sky hides above the tree cover,
        but I can tell from the crisp breeze that storm clouds are brewing overhead.\n
    \nThe dangers of our expedition have been explained to us many times. We are hundreds of miles away from any sign
        of civilization. Nobody in modern times has yet to pierce the heart of these wilds. Until now, nobody has had
        reason to try. After all, it wouldn’t make sense to find Aztec ruins in this region of Mexico. And yet, here
        we are: looking for ruins that may not exist in a place where, by all accounts, they should not.\n
    \nAlready one of our surveyors has fallen ill, and another has been bitten by a viper. I’m starting to think the
        rainforest doesn’t want us here. If this luck persists, ours will be the shortest expedition in Miskatonic
        University’s history. Tonight, we rest. Tomorrow, we venture into uncharted wilds.</string>

    <string name="eztli_introduction_one">Wednesday, July 8th, 1925\n
    \nOur runners, José and Maria, returned several days later. They were fully stocked with food, water, aspirin,
        and weapons. I am curious how deep Alejandro’s connections are in Mexico. For an outcast historian, he was
        able to secure guns and ammunition faster than I had anticipated. But perhaps it is better if he keeps his
        sources undisclosed.\n
    \nWe ventured once more into the jungle. This time, we were prepared. We had learned from our previous excursion,
        and we made our way across the river canyon, venturing deeper south than we had dared before. Eventually we
        reached the ruins Alejandro sought, and soon we will enter what Alejandro believes is the main temple.
        Strangely, the serpent creatures we encountered earlier didn’t attack in force as we had feared. Could they
        have fled? Or are they simply lying in wait, preparing to ambush while we sleep at night?</string>
    <string name="eztli_introduction_two">Friday, July 3rd, 1925\n
    \nWe spent most of yesterday moving our camp to the edge of the ruins. With the serpentine creatures still
        guarding the region, we have decided that a small party will have the best chance of slipping into the main
        temple unnoticed. I told Maria, the expedition’s naturalist, to take one of the trucks and wait beyond the
        northern edge of the rainforest. Our cartographer, José, is guarding the camp until we return. We’re on our
        own, but at least we’ve cleared an escape route in the event things go sour…</string>

    <string name="threads_introduction_one">The night passes with Ichtaca resting in your living room. You get no
        sleep for the remainder of the night, your thoughts drifting between concern and disbelief. Her story is
        preposterous, but you feel compelled to believe it nonetheless. You’ve known that the relic from the Eztli
        ruins had some deeper purpose ever since you first laid eyes on it. When you emerge from your bedroom the
        next morning, your uninvited guest is sitting at your dining-room table, arms crossed tightly across her
        chest. Her piercing eyes trace your every move like a bird watching its prey. No pleasantries are exchanged.
        “Where is the relic now?” Ichtaca asks impatiently. “Where have you brought it?” You explain that it is safe,
        in good hands. She shakes her head, her knuckles white with frustration. “I assure you it is not.”\n
    \nSetting aside your many questions for the time being, you call your contact at the Miskatonic University
        Museum. Despite the early hour, Dr. Horowitz should be at her office preparing for the long day ahead of her.
        The operator connects you after a short delay. Elli gives you an unusually curt greeting, her voice cracking
        and unsteady. As soon as you ask about the relic, she scoffs. “Not you, too! Mr. Walsted is practically
        knocking down my office door, and two reporters have been harassing me all morning!”\n
    \nYou ask her what the trouble is, and she lets out a long sigh. “The relic is <i>missing</i>,” she explains.
        “None of the security guards knows what happened. One minute it was in its display case; the next it was
        gone. And before you ask, no, Mr. Vela is nowhere to be found.” Suddenly she is yelling to another party,
        “One moment please! I am on the telephone!” She apologizes to you tersely and hangs up a moment later.\n
    \nSure enough, Alejandro is not answering his telephone, and none of his other associates have seen him since
        yesterday. “Believe me now?” Ichtaca asks, rising to her feet and gathering her things. “We’ve wasted enough
        time. Find the relic and meet me back here tonight. <i>Don’t</i> follow me.”</string>
    <string name="threads_introduction_two">The night passes with Ichtaca resting in your living room. You get no

    \nSetting aside your many questions for the time being, you call Harlan’s office at the university. Though the
        sun is barely peeking over the horizon, you’ve always known him to be an early riser. The operator connects
        you after a short delay. Harlan’s voice is shaky and rough. He cuts you off as soon as you ask about the
        relic. “Don’t!” he barks. “They’re listening. They know I am keeping it here. They have already taken
        Alejandro.” You try to calm him down so you can ask him what he means, but he cuts the conversation short. “I
        have to go. They are here!—” The line goes dead.\n
    \nSure enough, Alejandro is not answering his telephone, and none of his other associates have seen him since
        yesterday. “Believe me now?” Ichtaca asks, rising to her feet and gathering her things. “We’ve wasted enough

    <string name="threads_introduction_option_one">“You’re not going anywhere until you tell me what is going on.”</string>
    <string name="threads_introduction_option_two">“Have it your way.”</string>
    <string name="threads_introduction_three">Ichtaca grits her teeth and pauses. You expect her to refuse and leave
        without answering your questions, but surprisingly, she relents. According to Ichtaca, her people have spent
        ages protecting the relic from interlopers who would use it for nefarious purposes. She speaks cryptically,
        in half-riddles and tall tales, although she refuses to explain where her people come from and how they have
        remained hidden for so long. When pressed about the relic, all she says is that it controls the flow of time,
        and that it must not be tampered with.\n
    \n“It must return to its rightful place,” she explains. Her gaze is relentless, unwavering. “Do you understand?
        It cannot fall into the wrong hands. If you help me recover it, I will aid you in return. Just promise me you
        <i>will not use it</i>.”\n
    \n<b>Remember that “you listened to Ichtaca’s tale.”</b>\n

    \nOnce Ichtaca has left, you consider her words carefully and recall the events that have led to this point. You
        did not trust Alejandro with the Eztli relic, and you let Ichtaca leave without questioning her. Are you just
        being paranoid?…</string>

    <string name="boundary_introduction_one">Rays of hot yellow sunlight beat down on you from above as your car
        speeds down the dusty highways of southern Texas, just outside of San Antonio. It has been several days since
        you hit the road from Arkham on your way to Mexico City, where you may be able to get answers from some of
        Alejandro’s associates—or even better, from his adversaries in academia. Your recent investigations in Arkham
        uncovered much, but despite all the knowledge you laid bare, the trail went cold soon after. The
        “Brotherhood” that you exposed in Arkham has all but vanished from the city. Its members left behind little
        information as to their next objective, other than the name “The Nexus of N’kai,” a place of power that
        Ichtaca believes is the Brotherhood’s ultimate destination. Enigmatic as ever, the Eztli warrior sits in the
        passenger seat next to you. She is tense and coiled like a spring, the Ford’s leather seat offering her
        little comfort.\n\n</string>
    <string name="boundary_introduction_two_a">“How close are we?” Ichtaca asks for the hundredth time since
        departing from Arkham. “We have to get to Anahuac as fast as we can. The longer we take, the more time the
        Brotherhood has to reach the Nexus.” You recognize the old Aztec name for the Valley of Mexico, and inform
        Ichtaca that you will be crossing the border into Mexico within the hour. She crosses her arms and grits her
        teeth.\n\n</string>
    <string name="boundary_introduction_two_b">Ichtaca is quiet and pensive for the majority of your journey. Your
        questions are met with a wall of silence and a steely glare. Whatever she has planned, you are being left in
        the dark.\n\n</string>
    <string name="boundary_introduction_three_a">Throughout the journey south, the device you recovered from the
        clutches of the Brotherhood continues its endless humming, wrapped in a thin bedsheet on the back seat of
        your car. Your understanding of the relic’s nature is deepening.\n\n</string>
    <string name="boundary_introduction_three_b">The loss of the Eztli relic weighs heavily on your mind. Clearly,
        its value is more than simply academic. It holds a power within it that you cannot yet begin to fathom. You
        are certain that the shadowy Brotherhood is behind its disappearance, but for what purpose?\n\n</string>
    <string name="boundary_introduction_four_a">Throughout your journey, Alejandro scribbles endlessly in his
        journal, the sound of pencil scratching against paper a constant reminder of his presence. He remains huddled
        in the back seat of the car, his knees keeping the journal still, his brows furrowed in thought. “This
        ‘Brotherhood’ is the least of our concerns,” he says with an air of finality. “I’ve been trying to decrypt
        the glyphs the device bears. The symbols are clearly not Aztec, nor Mayan, nor are they from any other
        Mesoamerican civilization, for that matter. I believe there is some other place the relic belongs. Somewhere
        it was taken from. Wouldn’t you agree, Miss Ichtaca?”\n
    \nIchtaca’s already-grim expression grows darker, her eyes narrowing. She doesn’t bother to turn around in her
        seat before addressing Alejandro. “It belongs somewhere meddlesome scholars cannot abuse its power,” she
        replies in a cold tone, and that is the end of the discussion.\n
    \nCrossing the border into Mexico is a less stressful endeavor than you imagined it to be, due to Alejandro’s
        connections. You are waved through customs with nary a stray glance, and soon enough, you are on your way to
        Mexico City.\n\n</string>
    <string name="boundary_introduction_four_b">Somewhere just north of the border, you stop to rest for the night.
        Your eyes are drawn to the empty seat behind you, and you wonder where Alejandro is right now.\n\n</string>
    <string name="boundary_introduction_five">Fuel is a constant concern throughout your journey south. You are able
        to refuel several times along the way at general and hardware stores, but eventually your car putters out
        along the side of the road, just north of the southern border. You and Ichtaca are forced to walk several
        miles to the nearest town to refuel, setting you back several hours.\n\n</string>
    <string name="boundary_introduction_six">After arriving in Mexico City, you are disheartened to find very little
        information regarding the Brotherhood or the Nexus. You peruse the archives of the city’s libraries and
        universities, but come up emptyhanded. You can’t find any of Alejandro’s former colleagues in the city, and
        even his enemies refuse to speak to you, save for one: a woman named Padma Amrita, who studied Alejandro’s
        work before he came to Arkham. She agrees to meet you at a trendy lounge in the southern part of the city,
        late at night. Ichtaca remains a short distance away, observing your new informant silently.\n
    \nPadma knows a lot about Alejandro’s research, and even claims to have heard of the Nexus of N’kai, though she
        refuses to tell you how to find it. “It is a fool’s errand,” she tells you. “There is nothing to find. Just a
        myth. Trust me, many have searched for it. None have found it.” You point out that the Eztli people were not
        a myth, and she responds with a charming smile. “Perhaps not, but all this about the Eztli still being alive?
        Undiscovered for centuries?” She laughs heartily. “Bushwa, pure and simple. Come now, you don’t expect real
        scholars to believe that, do you?” Your eyes are drawn to Ichtaca, who is overhearing the conversation with
        crossed arms, her nails dug into her forearms. Padma’s eyes wander over as well, the hint of a smirk on her
        lips. “In any event, I apologize, but I don’t have any information for you. Only a sap would continue this
        ‘research’ any further. Good day.” Padma leaves with another alluring smile, a sweet scent trailing behind
        her as she departs.\n
    \nOnce she is out of sight, Ichtaca sits down next to you, and you discuss your next move. After a week of
        failure after failure, she has grown impatient. You offer a few more suggestions regarding whom you could
        speak to next, but her mind is elsewhere. When you return to your hotel, she immediately retreats to her room
        to make preparations for tomorrow. You decide to settle in for the night, and before long, your mind is
        meandering hazily into a dreamless slumber. In the far recesses of your awareness, however, you can hear
        Ichtaca reciting a cryptic incantation…</string>

    <string name="heart_one_intro">It has been several days since your party ventured forth into the rainforest once
        more, and each day, the hazards you face grow more dangerous and frequent. Securing enough food and supplies
        for the journey is a constant struggle, and you are harassed at every turn by the jungle’s inhabitants.
        Fortunately, you have seen no sign yet of the serpent people who attacked the previous expedition, but you’re
        positive they are out there. Watching. Waiting.\n
    \nOn the morning of the sixth day, you find the entrance. It is a huge cave opening, partially obscured by trees,
        brush, and vines. You nearly missed the great cavern maw altogether, despite its enormity. Surrounding the
        cavern’s entrance are six stone pillars, each covered in strange grooves and carvings that glow with a dim
        red hue. Perhaps one of your guides will understand what this means?</string>
    <string name="heart_one_intro_option_one">Let’s consult with Ichtaca.</string>
    <string name="heart_one_intro_option_two">Let’s consult with Alejandro.</string>
    <string name="heart_one_intro_option_three">Let’s consult the expedition journal.</string>
    <string name="heart_one_intro_option_four">I wish we knew more about this...</string>
    <string name="heart_one_intro_one">“The entrance is warded against intruders,” Ichtaca says cryptically, her eyes
        closed as though probing the cavern with unnatural senses. “These pillars are the key. Each is a test of wit
        and will.” She steps toward one of them and touches it with her palm, and its glow brightens. You notice now
        that the grooves along the pillar’s foundation depict a pattern you have seen somewhere before. If Ichtaca
        believes this place to be warded, you trust her opinion—there must be some way to break these wards…</string>
    <string name="heart_one_intro_two">Alejandro examines each of the pillars studiously. “It is a lock of some sort.
        Look here, see? The grooves do not line up perfectly.” He twists one of the pillars, and you can see the
        pattern along its side shifting. “I wager if we entered the cave, we would not get very far without these
        pillars in the correct formation. Just a hunch, I suppose…But I think we should examine this area further
        before we proceed.” You know Alejandro well enough by now to know that his hunches tend to be correct.</string>
    <string name="heart_one_intro_three">The previous expedition’s journal doesn’t have all the answers, but as you
        browse its pages, you are struck by a familiar diagram—one drawn by Lorenzo, an expedition member who never
        made it back to Arkham. It is a delicate recreation of a carving that was on the wall of one of the Eztli
        ruins. Many of the patterns and hieroglyphs you see in this drawing are shared among these pillars. It cannot
        simply be a coincidence. These pillars are surely the key to finding your way to N’kai…</string>

    <string name="heart_two_intro">You descend down miles of steep, cold stone. The tunnels are chokingly narrow at
        first, filled with rubble and detritus. Finally, you reach level ground, and the cavern’s true nature reveals

        a stone curtain of sky above you. Even more vast and terrifying are the endless depths below you, beyond the

    \nI still have no idea how we made it back to camp alive.\n
    \nThe jungle was more perilous than we could have possibly imagined. This may read like the ravings of a lunatic,
        but I cannot explain it any other way. Being lost in the jungle was no picnic, but that was the least of our
        worries. The rainforest was <i>guarded</i>. Guarded by unfathomable horrors: serpentine creatures driven by anger
        and hate, hunting us relentlessly.\n
    \nPerhaps just as deadly were the human natives of the rainforest. They appeared to be Aztec warriors as far as
        dress and speech were concerned. Despite the conquering of the Aztec people hundreds of years ago, these
        warriors somehow survived. How they managed to remain undiscovered this long is beyond us. I thought
        Alejandro would be excited to learn more about them, but he was more disturbed than fascinated. I suppose he
        has a right to be incredulous. Nothing about this expedition makes sense.\n
    \nThe serpent creatures chased us for what seemed like days. Finally we were able to find our way back to camp,
        but the price was steep. We had lost all progress we had made, and many of us were injured or afflicted by
        serpent venom. We have no choice but to send runners to the nearest city for additional supplies and to wait
        and recover from our wounds.</string>

    \nSomehow, after much toil and many hours of exploration we found the ruins that Alejandro sought, though we
        scarcely could have been ready for what we encountered in the wilds of the jungle. The rainforest was
        <i>guarded</i>. Guarded by unfathomable horrors: serpentine creatures driven by anger and hate. They hunted us
        relentlessly, wielding primitive weaponry and communicating in sharp hisses.\n

        warriors somehow survived. How they managed to remain undiscovered this long is beyond us. The warrior named
        Ichtaca was particularly intriguing. We were able to defuse the initial encounter with her, and surprisingly,
        she helped guide us through the jungle, only to disappear mysteriously when we reached the ruins. I have a
        feeling we have not seen the last of her.\n
    \nAlejandro did not agree with our decision to trust the Eztli warriors. He’s decided to stay at camp until
        further notice, disturbed as he is by their presence. I thought he would be excited to learn more about them,
        but I expect this discovery defies even his broad-minded theories. I suppose he has a right to be
        distrustful. Nothing about this expedition makes sense.\n
    \nWe have cleared a route to what Alejandro believes is the main temple of the ruins. There is little time to
        rest. The serpent creatures seem intent on stopping us, so we cannot tarry any longer than necessary. Soon we
        will enter the ruins to see what secrets they hide.</string>

    \nThankfully, my gambit was worthwhile. While José and Andrea searched for the others, I snuck into the temple
        and took a different route. Having seen what we have seen, knowing what we know now, I couldn’t have
        returned to the university without evidence of our discovery. While the serpent creatures were distracted, I
        was able to reach a hidden passageway that led deeper underground.\n
    \nIn the central chamber of these underground halls, I found the device. The orb was made of an unnatural steel,
        attached delicately to its bronze frame. It pulsed with power in my hands and glowed with a dim blue light.
        Any fool could tell that it was not made by the Aztecs, but the other members of the expedition could not
        even begin to understand its true significance. The ruins started to crumble around me as I left, but it
        mattered not. The relic was all that mattered now.\n
    \nWith the artifact in tow, I returned to camp and told the others it was time to depart. Maria was waiting for
        us with the trucks when we finally reached the northern edge of the jungle. Now we are headed to Texas, where
        we will cross the border into the United States.\n
    \nIt is a shame what happened to the others. Their sacrifice will not be in vain. Now, my work can continue.\n

    \nWe’ve made our decision. Alejandro is right: we’ve come too far to back down now. Our plan is to regroup and
        head back into the temple once more. Even from here, we can tell that the layout of the temple has warped and
        changed. The ruins seem to have reset to their dormant state. With any luck, we’ll make it out this
        time…\n

    <string name="eztli_resolution_five">(The following is scrawled below the previous journal entry.)\n
    \nWe made our decision. There was no way we were going back into that deathtrap. Thankfully, there was another
        way. José had brought some TNT from the trucks, and there was more than enough to level the damned place.\n
    \nThat night, we put on a hell of a fireworks show. The jungle protested. Birds scattered into the sky, the
        ground rumbled, and hateful snarls surrounded our camp. But the dynamite did its job. Once the dust settled,
        we began sifting through the debris in search of anything with historical or cultural significance we could
        bring back to Arkham.\n
    \nJosé was the first to notice the blue light peeking out from underneath the remains of the temple. The rays
        grew in intensity with each passing moment. As we started clearing the rubble in order to discover the source
        of the light, there was a sudden flash, and the debris at the center of the ruins scattered. A steel orb of
        unknown origin lay on top of the rubble, gently humming. It was attached delicately to a bronze frame,
        appearing almost religious in its significance. The blue glow emanating from the device dimmed as I touched
        it. There was no way a device like this was built by the Aztecs.\n
    \nWith the artifact in tow, we left the smoldering temple behind us. We had outstayed our welcome in this
        rainforest, and we knew it. Around us, the jungle hissed. The ground slithered and crawled with snakes. In
        the darkness, we heard shouts in a language we could not understand. There was no time to pack up camp; we
        ran as soon as we had the chance. Andrea was struck in her throat by a black-feathered arrow, her startled
        scream captured in grim perpetuity. José was grabbed by a giant boa as we fled north into the river canyon.
        His neck snapped before we could reach him.\n
    \nMaria was waiting for us with the trucks when we finally reached the northern edge of the jungle. We didn’t
        stop until we crossed into Mexico City. Even now I do not feel safe: who could, after seeing what we have
        seen?\n

    <string name="threads_resolution">You arrive back at your house and take stock of the situation. Your
        investigation throughout the city has uncovered the existence of a secret cabal within Arkham. From what you

        Alejandro’s previous expedition than even you do. Their methods are secret and furtive, and their motives
        elude you still. However, one piece of vital information has come to light.\n
    \n“They seek a place known as the Nexus of N’kai,” Ichtaca claims. A map of Central America lies on the table
        before you, marked with the previous expedition’s trail. “I have heard of this place, but its exact location
        is not known to me.” Once again, your mysterious guide appears to know more than she lets on.\n

    <string name="boundary_no_resolution">When you next open your eyes, you are back in the bed of your hotel room.
        You raise your hand to shield your eyes from the sunlight that pierces through the bedroom’s curtains. The
        glaring light is akin to a vice crushing your temples. Thin wisps of incense smoke fill the air.\n
    \nRising to your feet requires a colossal effort. A small voice in the back of your mind tells you it was all a
        figment of your imagination, a nightmare fueled by weariness. It is the voice of self-preservation warning
        you to avoid the path of lunacy you have set upon. You ignore it and rise to your feet, your legs trembling
        with terror and exhaustion. Quietly, you call out for Ichtaca, wondering if she remembers what happened last
        night—or if she was even there to begin with. You find her slumped on the floor, her back against the door of
        the hotel room. She is unconscious and unresponsive, her face ashen. After several worrisome minutes
        attempting to wake her, you finally succeed. She sputters into consciousness, coughing violently and
        convulsing as though possessed. “The cave. The maw in the sky, bathed in red. Did you see it?”\n
    \nYour head pulses with pain as you attempt to remember the events of last night, and you shake your head. “It
        must be the path that leads to the Nexus,” she continues, gripping her head tightly with one hand. You
        attempt to help her to her feet, but she pushes you away. “What was I thinking? The boundary is thinning. Any
        tension and it could have snapped.” Her gaze shifts toward you. “I should not have involved you in this. But,
        like it or not, you are involved. It is too late to go back. I know where to find the Nexus, and you must
        journey with me.”</string>
    <string name="boundary_resolution_one">You are assailed by a prismatic assortment of colors and lights as your
        mind hurtles back into place. When you next open your eyes, you are lying in the city’s central plaza, your
        head still spinning from the sensation of plummeting. A small voice in the back of your mind tells you it was
        all a figment of your imagination, a daydream. It is the voice of self-preservation warning you to avoid the
        path of lunacy you have set upon. You ignore it and rise to your feet, your legs trembling with terror and
        exhaustion.\n
    \n“That woman…She must have realized who I am and followed through the breach I made. Perhaps she wished to know
        the location of the Nexus, as well,” Ichtaca says cryptically. Your head pulses with pain as you attempt to
        remember the events of the past few hours. “You saw it, did you not? The cave. The maw in the sky, bathed in
        red,” she continues, searching the sky in contemplation. “It must be the path that leads to the Nexus.”\n
    \nIt is difficult for you to recall with precision what happened on the other side, but the image of the red
        cavern flickers across your memory. You confirm with Ichtaca that you saw the cavern as well, and ask her how
        she knows it leads to the Nexus. Her bloodshot gaze meets yours, and you think you spot the hint of a smirk
        tugging on her lips. “It is a difficult thing…Peering across the boundary, into the very threads of time.
        Perhaps you are more than you seem,” she responds, the irony of her statement lost on her. Though she departs
        without answering your question, you understand the answer that remains unspoken: In the haze of broken
        timelines and unexplainable phenomena, the path you saw was “one future.” A future you intend to fulfill.</string>
    <string name="boundary_resolution_two">The boundary along the horizon shimmers as your path home closes before
        your eyes. The surreal haze and the weightlessness you have experienced throughout this vision fades, and you
        are left with the sudden understanding that this is not a dream. You are trapped in a time that is not your
        own, and Ichtaca is nowhere to be found.\n
    \nYou wander for what seems like hours. Days. Weeks. Your mind cannot take any more. The realization that you may
        be trapped here forever is terrifying. Desperation and despair take hold of your mind, a bout of madness and
        loneliness that you cannot escape.You no longer remember how long it has been since you arrived here. You
        have not slept or eaten.\n
    \nSuddenly, after an eternity of waiting, the boundary cracks, and the sky is flooded with a blinding white
        light. When you next open your eyes, you are lying in the city’s central plaza, your head still spinning from
        the sensation of plummeting. Ichtaca helps you to your feet, your legs trembling with terror and exhaustion.
        You ask her how long you were out, and she shakes her head. “It doesn’t matter. You’re here now.” You ignore
        her evasive answer, but resentment boils to the surface. Did she leave you behind on purpose, or by accident?
        “You saw it, did you not?” she asks. “The cave. The maw in the sky, bathed in red.” You stare blankly, your
        memory suddenly hazy. “It matters not,” she continues. “I know now where to find the Nexus, and you must
        journey with me.”</string>
